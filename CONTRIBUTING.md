# Contributing Guideline

- First, and the most importent one, make sure you read the [README.md file](README.md).
- Read the [issues](https://github.com/wevisdemo/parliament-watch/issues) carefully, comment on the issue that you want to work and we will assign you to that issue.
- For each issue, create a new branch name in the format of `username/issuenumber-description`.
- Add issue number as a commit message scope eg. `feat(issuenumber): commit description`.
- Open the pull requests (PR), with the same name of the issue, when you need a discussion or ready to be reviewed.
- Questions and discussion can be done on the Github's issue or PR in English or Thai (choose the one you are comfortable).

Thank you and enjoy coding!
